**summon your heros. save the city.**

bat signal is a tool for political organizations to send push notifications to supporters.

use this to pack meetings, blow up politicians' phone lines, comment on a fresh news article, or call in to a radio show. use it to remind people on the morning of a protest. use it only for good.

## the rules

* **apply sparingly**. nobody likes spam.

* **keep it actionable**. tell me where to be and when. if there's going to be public commentary, summarize the issue and give me talking points. if i'm calling a legislator, a rep, a senator, a radio show: same thing.

* **keep it immediate**. when my push notification shows up, it should ideally be something i can do right now. at worst, it should be something i can do later today.

## how it works

1. link your supporters to your-org.batsign.al

2. they sign up for notifications

3. when things are about to go down, activate your signal

   even if they are neither on your website nor ours, they'll be notified! browsers support [push notifications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API) nowadays.

## sign up

1. email `boss` at `batsign.al`

   tell us who you are. tell us whether you're a 501c3, 501c4, or other type of political organization. tell us, if you had these powers already, the most recent thing you would've used them for.

2. we'll be in touch
