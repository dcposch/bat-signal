    <h2>summon your heros. save the city.</h2>

    <p>bat signal is a tool for political organizations to send push notifications to supporters.</p>

    <p>use this to pack meetings, blow up politicians' phone lines, comment on a fresh news article, or call in to a radio show. use it to remind people on the morning of a protest. use it only for good.</p>

    <h2>the rules</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>apply sparingly</strong>. nobody likes spam.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>keep it actionable</strong>. tell me where to be and when. if there's going to be public commentary, summarize the issue and give me talking points. if i'm calling a legislator, a rep, a senator, a radio show: same thing.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>keep it immediate</strong>. when my push notification shows up, it should ideally be something i can do right now. at worst, it should be something i can do later today.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>how it works</h2>

    <ol>
      <li><p>link your supporters to your-org.batsign.al</p></li>
      <li><p>they sign up for notifications</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>when things are about to go down, activate your signal</p>
        <p>even if they are neither on your website nor ours, they'll be notified! browsers support <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API">push notifications</a> nowadays.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2></a>sign up</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>email <code>boss</code> at <code>batsign.al</code></p>
        <p>tell us who you are. tell us whether you're a 501c3, 501c4, or other type of political organization. tell us, if you had these powers already, the most recent thing you would've used them for.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>we'll be in touch</p>
      </li>
